# tweetcollector
Quick script to turn a text file of tweet URLs into a grid of embedded tweets.

## Usage

Add tweet URLs (one per line, no extra query parameters) to a text file, then pass the file name to tweetcollector like so:

`python tweetcollector.py "filename.txt"`

An HTML file with the same filename will be generated. It will contain a grid of embedded tweets ideal for screenshotting or admiring in your free time.

## TODO

[] Use a more Masonry-style layout
